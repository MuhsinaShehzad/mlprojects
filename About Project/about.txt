*Project Description:

This project uses a dataset of medical insurance information to build a regression model that predicts insurance charges.
The dataset includes variables such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.
The goal is to understand which features most affect insurance costs and create a predictive model using Python.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Tools & Technologies:

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy (py libraries)

scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVR, Gradient Boost, XGBoost)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):

Smokers are charged significantly higher insurance premiums than non-smokers.

BMI (especially >30, indicating obesity) is correlated with higher charges.

Age is positively correlated with insurance charges — older people tend to pay more.

Sex and region have comparatively lower impact on charges.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Models Used:

You tested multiple regression models including:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

XGBoost Regressor (with hyperparameter tuning)
------------------------------------------------------------------
*Best Performing Model:

XGBoost Regressor gave the highest accuracy and best performance.

“XGBoost model is giving the highest accuracy — predictions made by this model are closest to the real values compared to others.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Feature Importance (from final model):

Top predictors of charges:

Smoking status

BMI

Age

Number of children (minor influence)

Region (least influential)
